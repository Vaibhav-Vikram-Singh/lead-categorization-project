Project Report: Lead Categorization Tool

Problem:

Identifying the business category of companies based on their website content can improve lead prioritization for investment or outreach.

Approach:

Collected textual data from company homepages and common subpages using Requests and BeautifulSoup (with Selenium as fallback).
Combined and cleaned all text into a single field per domain.
Defined keyword sets for 4 categories: AI, SaaS, Fintech, and Developer Tools.
Scored websites based on keyword frequency.
Selected the most likely category using max scoring.

Data Preprocessing:

Removed scripts/styles
Joined subpage texts
Removed empty or failed scrape results

Category Mapping:

Category                      Keywords Used

AI                            artificial intelligence, LLM, deep learning...

SaaS                          SaaS, subscription, software as a service

Fintech                       finance, payment, banking, transaction

Developer_Tools               API, SDK, integration, infrastructure


Model:

No ML model used; keyword-based rule system.
Easy to extend with TF-IDF, embeddings, or classification model later.

Evaluation:

Visual inspection of predicted categories.
Categories aligned well with company functions.
Visualization: bar chart of category distribution.

Tools Used:

Python, Jupyter
BeautifulSoup, Selenium, pandas, matplotlib
